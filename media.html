Son, as your lawyer, I declare y'all are in a 12-piece bucket o' trouble. But I done struck you a deal: Five hours of community service cleanin' up that ol' mess you caused.</p>

  <p>Oh, you're a dollar naughtier than most. I just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Fry, that doesn't make sense. No! The cat shelter's on to me. Bender, being God isn't easy.
